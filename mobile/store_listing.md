## Full Description (4000 chars max)
Struggling to decide what to do next? What Now? is an ADHD-friendly task management app that helps you stop overthinking and start doing.

Instead of staring at an overwhelming to-do list, What Now? asks three simple questions:
- How much energy do you have?
- What's your social battery like?
- How much time do you have?

Then it shows you matching tasks one at a time. Swipe right to accept, left to skip. No decision paralysis. No overwhelm. Just action.

KEY FEATURES:

Task Matching
Tell the app how you're feeling right now, and it finds tasks that match your current state. Low energy? It won't suggest deep work. Only have 5 minutes? It won't show you hour-long tasks.

Swipe to Decide
Tasks appear as cards you can swipe. Right means "I'll do this." Left means "not right now." Simple, fast, no overthinking required.

Gamification
Earn points for completing tasks. Rise through the ranks from Newbie to Legend. Stay motivated with fun celebrations and progress tracking.

Quick Add
Add tasks in seconds with a guided wizard. Pick a type, set the time, energy, and social level - done. Batch add up to 5 tasks at once, or import from a list.

Templates
Save task configurations as templates for quick reuse. Perfect for recurring routines.

Calendar View
See upcoming tasks and track your completed task history at a glance.

Groups & Leaderboards
Create or join groups with friends and family. Compare weekly points on the leaderboard and complete group challenges together.

Offline First
Works without internet. Your tasks sync automatically when you're back online.

What Now? is built specifically for people with ADHD, executive dysfunction, or anyone who gets stuck deciding what to do. It's not about managing tasks - it's about removing the barrier between thinking and doing.

Free version includes up to 10 active tasks with ads. Upgrade to Premium for unlimited tasks and an ad-free experience.
